		<!-- Grid sources require additional information about the distribution 
			of focal mechanisms and depths to use: - 'magDepthMap' is a ';' separated 
			list cutoff magnitudes mapped to depths and associated weights. In the example 
			below events of M<6.5 are located at a depth of 5 km, with a full weight 
			of 1. The [depth:weight] mapping may contain multiple, ',' separated values, 
			e.g. [6.5::[5.0:0.8,1.0:0.2], ...]. - 'maxDepth' constrains the maximum depth 
			of any finite point source representations. - 'focalMechMap' is a ',' separated 
			list of focal mechanism identifiers and associated weights. - In both maps 
			above, weights must sum to 1. - Use 'NaN' for unknown strike. Note that if 
			a strike value is defined, sources will be implemented as FIXED_STRIKE and 
			any configuration settings will be ignored. -->
